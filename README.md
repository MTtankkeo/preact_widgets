# React Widgets
This is package that provides templates that can significantly reduce CSS development works in a react development environment.

> Consider integrating not only business logic but also design logic into script code.

```tsx
return (
    <Row gap="15px">
        <p>item 1</p>
        <p>item 2</p>
        <p>item 3</p>
    </Row>
)
```
